***Technology*** <br/>
We decided to go with the latest technologies for developing this application in order to give users a better experience.

*Frontend* <br/>
For the frontend, we will be using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. Bootstrap’s responsive CSS adjusts to phones, tablets, and desktops.  It also gives a more premium user interface and smoother experience.


*Backend & Database* <br/>
Python’s web framework - Django will be used as the website’s backend. Django ensures rapid development providing high security and maintenance. Django takes care of much of the hassle of web development, so we can focus on writing our code without needing to reinvent the wheel. We have used Django Database.  Django Database offers advanced features and reliability far beyond a typical freeware project.
