***Technology***
We decided to go with the latest technologies for developing this application in order to give users a better experience.

*Frontend* <br/>
For the frontend, we will be using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap. Bootstrap’s responsive CSS adjusts to phones, tablets, and desktops.  It also gives a more premium user interface and smoother experience.

*Backend & Database* <br/>
Python’s web framework - Django will be used as the website’s backend. Django ensures rapid development providing high security and maintenance. Django takes care of much of the hassle of web development, so we can focus on writing our code without needing to reinvent the wheel. We will be using MySQL as the database. MySQL offers advanced features and reliability far beyond a typical freeware project.

*Additional Technologies* <br/>
Django-allauth will be used to allow users to login using their Facebook, Instagram, or Google account. <br/>
A database of online shops and their details & latest discounts will be stored in an excel file. Python pandas will be used to read those data using read_excel & integrate with MySQL.
